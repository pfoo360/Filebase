# Filebase

# About

A small feature of my previous project allowed users to upload pictures. Those images, however, were stored locally within an 'uploads' directory within the project itself and not in the cloud. I was not satisified with that aspect of the project so I decided to create this app to learn about storing images remotely and retrieving those images when needed. Filebase is a simple file hosting app. Users are able to upload files and then download them at a later time.
